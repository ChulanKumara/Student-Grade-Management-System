MODULE 1 : Object Oriented Programming with C++

	C++ is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, 
	object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing 
	facilities for low-level memory manipulation.

	It was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded,
	resource-constrained and large systems, with performance, efficiency
	and flexibility of use as its design highlights.


MODULE 2 : Computer Technology

	The computer technology program transforms students into technology
	leaders in a sustainable global economy.  This is achieved by 
	presenting students with a strong foundation in the concepts, 
	theories, and practices that serve as the basis for the varying 
	aspects of information technology. This includes the design,
	implementation, and adminstration of secured systems and networks.
	Students have the opportunity to develope expertise in specialty
	areas of interest through electives in higher level technology
	courses.

MODULE 3 : Internet Technology
		
	he Internet is the global system of interconnected computer 
	networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link 
	billions of devices worldwide. It is a network of networks that 
	consists of millions of private, public, academic, business, 
	and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a 
	broad array f electronic, wireless, and optical networking 
	technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of 
	information resources and services, such as the inter-linked
	hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web 
	(WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks 
	for file sharing.
